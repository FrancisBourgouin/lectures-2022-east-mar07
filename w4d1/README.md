# W4D1 - Intro to CSS

## Today's menu

- The week's project & main learnings
- Writing semantic HTML
- Box model
- block level elements vs inline elements
- Box sizing: border-box (non-default)
- CSS Selector
- CSS Specificity
- Float
- Flexbox

## Approach

As the weeks progress there is lesser emphasis on giving you all the resources, functions, tips that you need to complete an activity. We expect from you to:

- To research some subjects on your own.
- Don't hesitate to ask for help when stuck.
- Copy & Pasting error message on google to find a solution is a good start, but make sure to understand what's happening.

## This week

This week is about the frontend, so we will talk about HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

'Classic' front-end = HTML + CSS + JavaScript

- HTML = Structure of your page
- CSS = styling of your page
- JS = Interactivity

### HTML vs Semantic HTML

- Tags _give meaning_ to the content rather than just structure
- Give more info about the content to the browser
- Useful to search engine
- List of semantic tags introduced in HTML 5

```html
<article>
  <aside>
    <details>
      <figcaption>
        <figure>
          <footer>
            <header>
              <main>
                <mark>
                  <nav>
                    <section>
                      <summary>
                        <time></time>
                      </summary>
                    </section></nav
                ></mark>
              </main>
            </header>
          </footer>
        </figure>
      </figcaption>
    </details>
  </aside>
</article>
```

## CSS Syntax

When we write CSS, we first need to target (or filter) a list of element and then attribute it a style block

```css
selector-target-filter {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  ...and other style;
}
```

### What can we target?

## Add styles to an HTML page

There is 3 main ways to add styles on HTML elements. You can

- Add it directly to the element (inline) `<p style="font-size:5px">I AM SMALL</p>`
- Add it as a style tag `<style> p{ font-size:5px; } </style>`
- Add it as an external dependency `<link ref="stylesheet" href="..." />`

## CSS Box Model â¬œ

The box model is fundamental in CSS and we always need to be aware of it if we want a good visual presentation.

- Box-sizing property

## Block-Level Elements

- div
- header, main, section, nav, footer
- p, ul, li

### Inline Elements

- Inline elements are taking only the space bounded by the tag
- Does not disrupt the flow of the content
- The top and bottom margins/paddings are NOT respected
- `span, em, strong` are inline elements

### Inline-block elements

- Behave like inline elements
- The top and bottom margins/paddings are respected
- Does not break the line

The CSS display property can change the type of element

```css
span {
  display: inline-block;
  color: green;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  border: 1px solid mediumblue;
}
```

## CSS Layouts

- Floats
- Flexbox

## Layout with Floats ðŸ‘¿

- Float is a CSS positioning property
- Initially used to wrap text around images
- Floats was being used for web layouts
- Element can be floated left or right
- Since the flow is changed, elements are not part of the normal flow
- The parent element contained floated elements can collapsed

## Flexbox â™¥

## CSS Selector

### CSS Syntax

- selector + style block

```css
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  ...;
}
```

### Types of Selectors

- Basic Selector
- Class Selector
- ID Selector
- Attribute Selector
- Descendant Selector
- Sibling Selector

- [Selectors](https://jsfiddle.net/dtremblay/e3v095ws/94/)

## CSS Specificity

### Specificity Rules

- The more specific selector gets applied
- A score is attributed to a selector

  - nb ids x 100 pts
  - nb classes x 10 pts
  - nb of elements x 1pt

* inline-style => 1000 pts
