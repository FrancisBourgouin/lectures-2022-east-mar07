# What is mystifying ?

- Super lost in the code, what to do ? OK
- Week of fire OK
- useState(props.student || "") ?? OK
- Controlled components OK
- useEffect dependency array magic OK
- Inner workings of setState OK

# Tips to not get lost

- Map app structure
- Data structure
- 1 month of testing

# Week of fire ? (This is fine)

- Review week
- Fine to be behind a little bit
